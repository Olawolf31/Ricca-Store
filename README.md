## Ricca Store

The project is an ecommerce website built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website uses Redux for state management, Swiper JS for image sliders, React Router for routing, Tailwind for styling, and Vite for development.

The website allows users to browse and purchase products online. It has a clean and intuitive interface. The website also includes a shopping cart and checkout process for completing purchases.

The website has been optimized for performance, with fast page load times and smooth transitions between pages. The use of Swiper JS allows for a visually appealing and interactive image slider on the homepage.

The styling of the website has been done using Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. This allows for quick and easy customization of the website's look and feel.
